## Abstract 

Image reconstruction and copy image for gery are two of the most popular research fields in image processing nowadays.
Various techniques and methodologies have been developed to reconstruct an image. Patch match algorithm is used for finding
and replacing the nearest matching patch selected by user. Over the years, many techniques have been developed and used in
this application. In this work, we have proposed an approach which is ahybrid of the kNN classification algorithm, k-D tree
algorithm and random search. The results suggest that they perform optimally when used together, by reducing the overall time
complexity to O(mklog M), where mis the number of pixels in the selected patch and k is the number of nearest pixels that are
being searched in the image for every pixel present in the patch. This approach finds the globally dense matches for the patch
selected in an efficient and optimal way. The patch match algorithm is especially useful in computer vision applications like
object detection and symmetry detection.
